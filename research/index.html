 				<ul>
<li>  (2019) <a href="papers/contrahandout.pdf"> Contrafactives: What Are They, Why Don't They Exist?</a>. This is a handout for an informal talk I gave at the UConn Philosophy Brown Bag series. It's mostly just mulling over a stray observation that seems to elude a good explanation. Subsequently, nothing too developed here, however, I think it's fun to think about it. </li>
