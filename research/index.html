<li>  (2019) <a href="/contrahanout.pdf"> Contrafactives: What Are They, Why Don't They Exist?</a>. This is a handout for an informal talk I gave at the UConn Philosophy Brown Bag series. It's mostly just me mulling over a stray observation that seems to elude a good explanation. Subsequently, nothing too developed here, however, I think it's a fun question to think about. </li>
