I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br/> My research mainly focuses on syntax, morphology, and the interaction between the two. My work involves both close investion of specific languages, especially Turkic languages, as well as cross-linguistic comparative research. Some topics I've been interested in recently include: cross-clausal argument licensing, and the interaction between head-movement and ellipsis.
