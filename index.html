I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a> Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br/> My research mainly focuses on syntax, morphology, and the interaction between the two. In particular, I am interested in cross-linguistic variation regarding particular phenomena, e.g. cross-clausal licensing/ECM, verb-straning ellipsis, differential object marking, and what these points of variation reflect regarding underlying differences in grammatical architecture.
