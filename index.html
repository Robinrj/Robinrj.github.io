I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I was a graduate student in the  <a hfref="https://philosophy.uconn.edu/">philosophy department </a> at UConn. I recieved my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br> My interest are primarily in semantics and pragmatics. Recently, I have been interested in attitude verbs, in particular, their behaviour in discourse. I also am interested in modality.
