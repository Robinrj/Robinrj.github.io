I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br/> My main areas of research are in theoretical syntax and morphology. I am especially interested in points of micro-variation observed between closely related languages, and how such variation can help develop our theoretical understanding of syntax more generally. Some topics that I've been interested in recently include: ellipsis and its interaction with head/phrasal movement, cross-clausal argument licensing, and differential object marking.
