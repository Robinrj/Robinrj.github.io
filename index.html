I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. </p>  

<p> Broadly speaking, my research focuses on syntax and morphology and cross-linguistic variation in those areas. Some topics my work has focused on include: cross-linguistic variation in the clausal middle-field, locality domains, differential object marking, ellipsis, PF movement, morphological case typology, syntactic variation in cross-clausal dependencies (e.g. ECM).
