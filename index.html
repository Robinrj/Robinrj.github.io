I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br/>  My research has focused on syntax and morphology, in particular, cross-linguistic variation in those areas. Recently, my work has focused on a number of phenomena including: verb-stranding ellipsis, differential object marking, cross-clausal dependencies (e.g. ECM).
