I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the University of Connecticut. Before that I was a graduate student in the philosophy department at UConn. Before that I recieved my BA in philosophy at the University of Toronto. <br> My interest are primarily in semantics and pragmatics. Recently, I have been interested in attitude verbs, in particular, their behaviour in discourse. I also am interested in modality.
