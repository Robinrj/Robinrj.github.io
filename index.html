I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I was a graduate student in the  <a hfref="https://philosophy.uconn.edu/">philosophy department </a> at UConn. I recieved my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br> Broadly speaking, I am interested in semantics and pragmatics. I have recently been working on the meaning of attitude verbs and their role in discourse structures. I'm also interested in the expression of perspective in language such as evidentiality and mirativity.
