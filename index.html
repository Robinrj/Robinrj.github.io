I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a> Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br/> My research mainly focuses syntax, morphology, and the interaction between the two. In particular, I am interested in how cross-linguisitic variation with respect to languages grammars is reflected in what derivational strategies are available to that language for a range of phenomena, including, A/A-bar movement; nominal licensing and agreement; and complementation.
