I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. </p>  

<p> Broadly speaking, my research mostly focuses on syntax and morphology and cross-linguistic variation in those areas. Some phenomena that my work has focued on includes: cross-linguistic variation in verb-stranding ellipsis, variation in the architecture of the clausal middle-field (in particular, locality domains), differential object marking, morphological case and agreement typology, and syntactic variation in cross-clausal dependencies (e.g. ECM). </p>
