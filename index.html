I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I was a graduate student in the  <a hfref="https://philosophy.uconn.edu/">philosophy department </a> at UConn. I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. <br> My main areas of research is in theoretical linguistics, primarily syntax and its interfaces, semantics, and morphology. I am for the most part interested in Turkic languages, in particular, Uyghur. <br> In terms of topics, I am interested in case, agreement, and movement. Lately, I have been thinking about how movement affects interpretation and how various languages encode semantic properties through movement such as definiteness.
